# CS 1632 - Software Quality Assurance
Summer Semester 2024

* DUE: July 23 (Tuesday), 2024 before start of class

**GitHub Classroom Link:** https://classroom.github.com/a/_H3CSzbp

## Description

For this assignment, you and a partner will write systems-level, automated
black-box tests for a web app using the Selenium IDE. 

The web app is located here: https://cs1632.appspot.com/

I am assuming that you have done Exercise 3 by now.  If you haven't, please go
do it before working on this deliverable.  I will skip detailed instructions on
the Selenium IDE that we already went over on Exercise 3.

For those of you who are working in groups, you will be working on the same
shared .side project file. So it is especially important that your pull before
opening the project file and push immediately after you have modified and saved
the project file. Otherwise, you may get merge conflicts. Merging conflicts is
possible by using the technique I went over with the
[Using\_Git](https://github.com/wonsunahn/CS1632_Summer2024/blob/master/lectures/Using_Git.pdf)
slides, but it's best to avoid it.  In the case of a merge conflict, the .side
file is in JSON format, so it shouldn't be too difficult to patch up.

## Task 1: Write test cases

Write all the test cases in [testplan.md](testplan.md) to test the requirements
listed in [requirements.md](requirements.md).  Name each test case using the
IDENTIFIER for the test case.  This is important for the purposes of GradeScope
autograding.  

### Test fixture

Note the existence of the Test Fixture at the beginning of the test plan.  As
we learned, a test fixture is a set of fixed preconditions that is common
across all test cases.  That means the test fixture has to be in place before
setting up any test-specific preconditions or performing the execution steps.
That means you will have to use the "open" command to open the target URL and
also reset the values of the specified cookies at the beginning of each test
case.

### Setting cookie values

Cookies are name/value pairs that are stored in your web browser to maintain
some state required by a website.  In our rent-a-cat website, the state that
needs to be maintained would be which cats have been rented out and which are
available.  The website creates three boolean name/value pairs to indicate the
rented state of each cat (true if rented or false if available).  The name of
each cookie is the ID of each cat: "1", "2", and "3".  These cookies are
manipulated by JavaScript code that runs on the web browser whenever you push
on the "Rent" or "Return" buttons.

Since the behavior of many rent-a-cat features are impacted by these cookies,
it is important that these cookies are set to certain values before testing.
So how can we set cookies in Selenium?  Fortunately, Selenium IDE provides a
way to execute arbitrary JavaScript code using the "run script" command.
In order to set all values of cookies "1", "2", and "3" to false, you need to
pass the following JavaScript code to the "run script" command:

```
document.cookie = "1=false";document.cookie = "2=false";document.cookie = "3=false";
```

You need to add that long string as a single line.  If you insert newlines at
the end of each statement in your head, it is the following JavaScript code:

```
document.cookie = "1=false";
document.cookie = "2=false";
document.cookie = "3=false";
```

Contrary to how it appears, you are not overwriting the document.cookie object
over and over again.  The document.cookie object has a special semantic where
assignment really means that you are adding that cookie to the list of existing
cookies.  If a cookie with the same name already exists, you will overwrite the
value.  That is as much you need to know about cookies concerning this
assignment.  If you want to learn more about cookie semantics, feel free to
browse the following page:

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp

You can test your JavaScript code directly on the web browser by entering the
code in the address bar at the top.  Try entering the following string in the
address bar while on the Rent-A-Cat page to set all cats to rented.

```
javascript:{document.cookie = "1=true";document.cookie = "2=true";document.cookie = "3=true";void(0)}
```

Then refresh the page and see all the cats disappear!  You may notice the extra
"void(0)" string in the end.  It is added to have the JavaScript code return an
undefined value --- otherwise, the web browser will display the value returned
on a new page, which is not what we want.

## Task 2: Find three defects and write test cases for them

This is another buggy product.  You should find at least three defects and
report them using the standard defect template (just like in the first
deliverable).  You may want to do some exploratory testing first to see what
kind of issues are found before writing automated tests for them.  Think of
equivalence classes, edge cases and corner cases as we learned so far.

Next, write three additional Selenium test cases that fail and uncover those three
defects.  Name these test cases in this format: DEFECT[N]-[Requirement Name],
where N is 1, 2, or 3.  For example,  if you found 2 defects related to the
FUN-RENT requirement and 1 defect related to the FUN-FEED-A-CAT requirement, you
will name them:

* DEFECT1-FUN-RENT
* DEFECT2-FUN-RENT
* DEFECT3-FUN-FEED-A-CAT

Normally you wouldn't name them this way since there is no separate category of
tests that are meant to detect defects.  All tests are meant to detect defects!
This is only for ease of grading on GradeScope.

## Task 3: Add test cases to test suite and save project

1. Choose "Test Suites" from the left panel drop down menu.

1. There will already be a "Default Suite" there with possibly one or more tests.

1. Right click on "Default Suite", or click on the vertical-3-dot context menu button, and select "Rename" and rename to "D3".

1. Right click on "D3", or click on the vertical-3-dot context menu button, and
   select "Add tests".  Make sure all tests are checked.  Press the "Select"
button.

1. Click on the "Save project" button on the top right corner that looks like a
   floppy disk.  Save to file name "D3.side" in the deliverable root folder.

## Task 4: Export test suite to JUnit class

Once you are done writing your Selenium test suite, let's try exporting the test
suite in Selenium IDE to a Java JUnit test class.  

Follow these instructions:

1. Right click on "D3", or click on the vertical-3-dot context menu
   button, and select "Export".

1. Select "Java JUnit" in the list of language options and optionally check
   "Include step descriptions as a separate comment" to generate more detailed
comments.  Leave other boxes unchecked.

1. Save the resulting file into "D3Test.java" under the
   src/test/java/edu/pitt/cs test source directory.  .

1. If you updated your browser since Exercise 3, please re-run
   selenium-manager to reinstall the web driver.

1. Add the following line to the top of "D3Test.java":
   ```
   package edu.pitt.cs;
   ```

1. Also add the following import to get avoid assertThat getting crossed out
   in VSCode:
   ```
   import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
   ```

1. Lastly, please add the @FixMethodOrder annotation before the D3Test class declaration:

   ```
   @FixMethodOrder(MethodSorters.NAME_ASCENDING)
   public class D3Test {
      ...
   ```

   In order to compile, you would also need the following imports:

   ```
   import org.junit.FixMethodOrder;
   import org.junit.runners.MethodSorters;
   ```

   This is to guarantee a fixed order when running @Test methods when the
GradeScope autograder runs so that grading results are deterministic and
reproducible.  Otherwise, @Test methods will run in arbitrary order.  Of
course, if you initialized your test fixture properly before every test case,
this should not matter but if you didn't, there is a possibility of
dependencies forming between test cases.

Now you can run the D3Test JUnit class using Maven:

```
mvn test
```

Make sure all tests pass by looking at the results (except for those that test
defects, which should fail of course).  If there are any failures, slightly
touch up the D3Test.java Selenium tests to make them pass.  Refer to the
Exercise 3 troubleshooting guide:

https://github.com/wonsunahn/CS1632_Summer2024/blob/main/exercises/3/README.md#tips-for-junit--selenium-problem-solving

# Submission

Each group will do one submissions to GradeScope as usual.  The submission is
done in two parts: the GitHub Classroom repository and a report.

## GitHub submission

Submit your github repository to GradeScope at the **Deliverable 3 GitHub**
link.  Once you submit, GradeScope will run the autograder to grade you and
give feedback.  If you get deductions, fix your code based on the feedback and
resubmit.  Repeat until you don't get deductions.

Please make sure you have the **D3.side** and **D3Test.java** files in your
repository.

## Report submission

Submit your report to GradeScope at the **Deliverable 3 Report** link.  Please
use the [ReportTemplate.docx](ReportTemplate.docx) file provided in this
directory to write a short report.  A PDF version of the file is at
[ReportTemplate.pdf](ReportTemplate.pdf).

Everyone should have a title page with:
* Your names / team name
* The title "CS 1632 - DELIVERABLE 3: Automated Web Testing"

On the FIRST PAGE introduction, please describe the division of work between
group members and also any difficulties you faced while using Selenium.

ON A SEPARATE PAGE, paste a link to your GitHub issues page with (at least)
three closed issues for three defects.  Each defect should contain all
necessary components including REPRODUCTION STEPS, EXPECTED BEHAVIOR, OBSERVED
BEHAVIOR, etc. described in Deliverable 1.  Just like for Exercise 2, please
modify the requirements to resolve these defects in an issue branch and then
merge them in using a pull request.  Don't forget to label and assign the
issue.

# Grading

* Summary and retrospective - 5% 
* Defect reports - 15%
* GitHub autograder results - 80%

Please review grading\_rubric.txt for details.

# GradeScope Feedback

The GradeScope autograder works in 2 phases:

1. **D3Test on https://cs1632.appspot.com/**: This tests your D3Test.java file
   on the D3 website as originally intended.  All of your tests should pass.

1. **D3Test on https://cs1632-buggier.appspot.com/**: This tests your
   D3Test.java on an even buggier version of the D3 website.  To do this, all your URLs are changed to the buggier website.  Now all tests should fail.  You can test this yourself easily by changing the base URL of your D3Test.java.

If you get deductions, both websites are available to you, so try them out
yourself.
